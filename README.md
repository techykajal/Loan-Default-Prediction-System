# Loan-Default-Prediction-System
Loan default prediction is a common problem in the financial industry, as it can help lenders or banks identify borrowers who are likely to default on their loans. This information can be further used to adjust loan terms/conditions, reserve additional funds to cover potential losses, or even deny/refuse loans to high-risk borrowers.
